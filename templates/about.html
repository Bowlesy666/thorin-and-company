        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came
        and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to
        add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that
        someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves
        also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
        fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile,
                he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
                fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and,
                using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him
                even in death.

                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin,
                grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest
                of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come
                along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire
                for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and
                later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin

                On October 25, 3018, Glóin and his son Gimli attended the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he greeted Frodo Baggins
                at the welcome dinner, after Frodo had recovered from his wound received from the Witch-king of Angmar. He recounted the
                history of the Lonely Mountain and the Kingdom of Dale since Bilbo had left, including Balin's decision to leave the
                Lonely Mountain and re-establish the ancient Dwarven kingdom in Moria. At the Council of Elrond, his son Gimli warned of
                the messengers from Mordor who had been threatening King Dáin II Ironfoot, seeking news of Bilbo, Frodo, and the One
                Ring. It is unknown whether Glóin fought against Sauron's forces in the Battle of Dale.
